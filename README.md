## Alexa Skill Project

Create an Alexa application capable of interacting with a user's medication. Once medicines are added to a user's Alexa device, our application will create reminders for scheduled doses, have the ability to query if the user is up-to-date with their medications, and get various details about their medicines.

Our application removes the burden and worry of taking regimented and scheduled medications. Our application will remind you when you should take which medicine and when. It also will provide feedback about your current medications, and whether you are on schedule for prescribed doses. This application is targeted at the elderly or anybody whose life is hectic and busy, and wish to be reminded about their medication instead of having to memorize their doses.

Invoke our skill with Alexa:

"Alexa open my med box demo"


## Technologies Used

Alexa Developer Console was used to interact with Alexa. For our backend, we used Java with Maven for our
 dependencies. To debug we used AWS CloudWatch to log out the errors. Since Alexa skill is a cloud-based service, to
  build this custom skill, AWS Lambda was used. It runs the code only when it's needed and scales automatically, so
   there is no need to provision or continuously run servers.
